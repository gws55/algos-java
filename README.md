For a string of N=3 unique characters, there are N! unique combinations as follows, in-order  
> abc  
> acb  
> bac  
> bca  
> cab  
> cba  
  
Implement an algorithm that, given two strings for a given N, returns the non-inclusive distance between them. For example, given the following input  
> N=3 cba acb  

the output is  
> 3
