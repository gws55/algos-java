Run solutions with
```

```
where [name].java and [name]_input.txt are located in directory ./[name]

For a string of N=3 unique characters, there are N! unique combinations in-order, as follows:  
```
abc  
acb  
bac  
bca  
cab  
cba  
```
  
Implement an algorithm that, given two strings for a given N, returns the non-inclusive distance between them. For example:  
```
N=3 cba acb => 3  
```
